            <p>

                Life is an unknown game, and every day you play on a new field. Every game has rules. Life's a game that
                has its respective rules; obey the rules, win the game!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>USEFULL?</h2>
            <p>Gaming is really a workout for your mind disguised as fun. Studies have shown that playing video games
                regularly may increase gray matter in the brain and boost brain connectivity.

            <h2>IMPORTANCE</h2>

            <h2>PURPOSE</h2>


            <p>Games generally involve mental or physical stimulation, and often both. Many games help develop practical
                skills, serve as a form of exercise, or otherwise perform an educational, simulational, or
                psychological role. </p>
